# Dekstop Wallpaper

This is my collection of wallpaper for desktop, it's not for 4K Monitor so please be aware. this originally from <https://github.com/UnknownRori/dotfiles/tree/master/vscode/background> but since it make that repository bloated I decided to put it in different repository.

## Preview

```md
OS          : Windows 10
Font        : Fira Code
Desktop     : DWM
Resolution  : 1366x768
```
## Note

There are 2 folder, one is `desktop` and the other one is `not-safe` I'm not sure what you can define safe or not safe, but for me it's barely not safe. Also that image in `desktop` already fit for below 4K landscape display.
